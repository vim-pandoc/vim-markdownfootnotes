# WARNING: git repository rebased to fix fsck issue

_April 16th, 2019_

This repository had (for its entire lifetime, inherited from the two commits in [VimFootnotes](https://github.com/vim-scripts/VimFootnotes)) an issue with malformed commits. If your git config had integrity checking turned on, it would only have been clonable with `git clone --config transfer.fsckobjects=false --config receive.fsckobjects=false --config fetch.fsckobjects=false <url>`. Per discussion in [issue #5](https://github.com/vim-pandoc/vim-markdownfootnotes/issues/5), the master branch of this repository was rebased to address this issue. This unfortunately means all forks and clones will need to be likewise rebased on the updated repository.

If you have a clone with no changes, one way to fix this is to blow it away and clone again. If you have local changes you'd like to keep, first fetch using `git fetch --all` then rebase using `git rebase origin/master` (replace origin with the upstream name if you have changed it).

## VimFootnotes for Markdown

This fork is a slight tweak of the venerable [vimfootnotes][], for use
with extended markdown.

The new script inserts footnotes in the widely supported extended markdown
syntax:

~~~
Here is some text.[^1]

[^1]: Here is a note.
~~~
)

The footnote number gets determined by an automatic counter whenever a new
footnote gets inserted. The counter works with the default arabic numerals
and all other settings provided by `b:vimfootnotetype`. The automatic counter
code is based on the code for the counting of HTML footnotes in [this post by
Nick Coleman][3], adjusted slightly to work with Markdown footnotes.

To insert a footnote, hit `<Leader>f` in normal mode or type `[]`. Then

- A footnote mark will be inserted after the cursor,
- A matching footnote mark will be inserted at the end of the file, and
- a split window at the bottom will open, ready to edit the new footnote.

When done, type `ZZ` to close the split and return to the main text.

## Installation

Drop `markdownfootnotes.vim` in your plugin directory.

Or use [Pathogen][6].

## Settings

By default, footnote ids are arabic numerals. You can change this by
setting `b:vimfootnotetype`:

+	`arabic`: 1, 2, 3...
+	`alpha`:  a, b, c, aa, bb..., zz, a...
+   `Alpha`:  A, B, C, AA, BB..., ZZ, A...
+   `roman`:  i, ii, iii... (displayed properly up to 89)
+   `Roman`:  I, II, III...
+   `star`:   \*, \*\*, \*\*\*...

You can optionally disable line breaks before each footnote by setting `g:vimfootnotelinebreak = 0`.

## Commands

`AddVimFootnote`
 :  inserts footnotemark at cursor location, inserts footnotemark on new
    line at end of file, opens a split window all ready for you to enter in
    the footnote.

`ReturnFromFootnote`
 :  closes the split window and returns to the text in proper place.

These are mapped to `<Leader>f` and `<Leader>r` respectively.

`FootnoteNumber`
 :  Change the current footnote number (one obligatory argument)
    :FootnoteNumber 5

`FootnoteNumberRestore`
 :  Restore old footnote number

`FootnoteUndo`
 :  Decrease footnote counter by 1

`FootnoteMeta [<footnotetype>]`
 :  Change type of the footnotes and restart counter (1, a, A, i, I, *)

The `<footnotetype>` argument is optional. If omitted, and your previous
footnote type was not `arabic`, the new type will be `arabic`; if it was
arabic, the new type will be `alpha`. If the new type is the same as the
previous type, then the counter will not be restarted.


`FootnoteRestore`
  : Restore previous footnote type and counter.
